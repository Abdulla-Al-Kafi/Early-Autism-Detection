# Early Autism Detection using Machine Learning

This project develops a machine learning model to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on demographic and health data. The optimized Random Forest model achieved 93% accuracy. The study includes data preprocessing, handling class imbalance using SMOTE, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, outlier detection, feature encoding)
- Class imbalance handling using SMOTE
- Model training and evaluation (Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost)
- Performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix




## Results
- Random Forest achieved **93% accuracy**
- Precision and recall analysis show improvements needed for ASD case detection
- Future work includes deep learning models and dataset expansion
